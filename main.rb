# Problem Solving Process
# Restate the goal. 
# Consider the data.
# Ask clarifying questions.
# Break it down.
# Research.
# Start coding. 
# Stuck? Go back to your pseudocode.
# Refactor.

# Challenge 1
# Write a method or function that accepts a string. The method or function should return a boolean that describes whether or not the string has an even number of characters.
def str(x)
    if x.length    
end
# Challenge 2
# Start with an array of strings. Then, print only the words with more than 3 characters.

# Challenge 3
# Write a method or function that takes an array of numbers as an argument.  The method or function should return the average of all the numbers, rounded to two decimal places.

# Challenge 4
# Start with an array of strings. Print all of the words in the array, that include the letter t or T.

# Challenge 5
# Write a method or function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9) and returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number. For example, if you were given [5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the method or function will return 555-123-4567.
